# Making-it-rain
 Cloud-based molecular simulations for everyone

**Hello there!**

This is a repository where you can find a Jupyter notebook scripts for running Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using OpenMM engine and AMBER and CHARMM force fields files on Google Colab. This repository is a supplementary material of the paper "***Making it rain: Cloud-based molecular simulations for everyone***" (link here) and we encourage you to read it before using this pipeline.

The main goal of this work is to demonstrate how to harness the power of cloud-computing to run microsecond-long MD simulations in a cheap and yet feasible fashion.
